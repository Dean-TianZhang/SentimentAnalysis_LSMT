This bag is the perfect blend of form and function!
I was excited for this bag, I do√±a lot of reasersh and definitely wasn't what I expected, in one month of used the material start pilling everywhere. I never put ion the floor , I place my bag next tonmenin the car, too of my desk. For been so pricey I expected more quality. My co-worker bought others brands at Tj-Maxx for $50 and they still look like new. Space inside is very usable and good to organize, plenty of space for laptop, makeup bag, charger, my 2 cell phones etc.. unfortunately the material isn't work at all. Very disappointed with this purchase and wasted of money.
I have loved this bag, and have received so many compliments on it. It is sturdy, well built and really well made overall, with the exception of the handles/ straps.s
